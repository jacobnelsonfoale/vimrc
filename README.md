# Vim Config
*NOTE: NO LONGER WORKS*
This is my vimrc

#### NOTE: THE ./theme-install.sh HAS BEEN UPDATED AND YOU NOW NO LONGER HAVE TO MAKE /colors AND /bundle DIRECTORY YOURSELF

## INSTALL 
to install all you need to do is make sure `git` command is installed

####  If you are using apt
`sudo apt update`
`sudo apt upgrade`
`sudo apt install git`
*Make sure you have wget install (please check the script to see what I use it for do not run random scripts you see on github the script is only a few lines long so their is absolutely not excuse for you being lazy)*
`sudo apt install wget`


### clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/Dunn-Dev8/vimrc`

### Make ./theme-install.sh Executable
`chmod +x ./theme-install.sh`

### Run ./theme-install.sh
`./theme-install.sh`

*Now Run vim and see all the new changes*
